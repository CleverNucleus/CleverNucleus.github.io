## Welcome

This wiki was created to provide documentation for the mods that I build for Minecraft. It aims to be a more comprehensive knowledge base than Githubâ€™s wiki pages, and offers a cleaner solution to publishing release-dependent content. 

## Structure

This wiki is structured such that each mod has a dedicated section that details them in their entirety. These are accessed through the main navigation bar at the top of the site. Once there, the different versions of the mod and its subdivisions can be traversed through the sidebar on the left. 

Each mod generally splits its content into two categories: gameplay and developer documentation. Where the latter tends to assume knowledge of the former, and broadly represents average player and modder use cases, respectively.
